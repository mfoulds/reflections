How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

Narrows down to the lines and then you can look at the lines.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

Easier to find bugs but also to pinpoint at what time an earlier error that may have stayed hidden may have occurred.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

Pros: Means that your checkpoints were consciously chosen. Not automatically at an inopportune time.
Cons: Forgetting to commit.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

Because project files may be inter-related so you want them all to stay synchronised with each other.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

use $git log --stat to pick up the stats as well (eg number of files added and removed)
use $git diff id1 id2 to pick up what specifically was changed

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?
