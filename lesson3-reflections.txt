When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
(1) in order to collaborate with others; (2) to have a cloud backup of your work


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
You may not be ready to make changes public, or you may still be working on something and not want to overwrite with commits by other collaborators.
