When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
(1) in order to collaborate with others; (2) to have a cloud backup of your work


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
You may not be ready to make changes public, or you may still be working on something and not want to overwrite with commits by other collaborators.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
A clone is a copy of a git with all commit history. A branch is a variation of a commit stream. A fork is basically a clone done on GitHub; it allows tracing back to the original source.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
So you can work on merges while offline if needed.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
You could save a new version of files each time it was important, or even save to a whole new folder for packaged versions. But it would be pretty hard to keep track of packaging, and also difficult to easily revert, see differences, etc.
